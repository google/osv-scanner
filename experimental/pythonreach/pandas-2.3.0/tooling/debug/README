The Docker image here helps to set up an isolated environment containing a debug version of Python and a gdb installation which the Cython debugger can work with.

If you have internet access, you can pull a pre-built image via

```sh
docker pull pandas/pandas-debug
```

To build the image locally, you can do

```sh
docker build . -t pandas/pandas-debug -f Dockerfile.pandas-debug
```

For pandas developers, you can push a new copy of the image to dockerhub via

```sh
docker push pandas/pandas-debug
```
