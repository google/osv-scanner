// - epoch, represented as "e"
// - version, represented as "v"
// - release, represented as "r"
// - architecture, represented as "a"

// - RPM package names are made up of five parts; the package name, epoch, version, release, and architecture (NEVRA)
// - The epoch is not always included; it is assumed to be zero (0) on any packages that lack it explicitly
// - The format for the whole string is n-e:v-r.a
//
// - parsing:
//   - If there is a : in the string, everything before it is the epoch. If not, the epoch is zero.
//   - If there is a - in the remaining string, everything before the first - is the version, and everything after it is the release. If there isnâ€™t one, the release is considered null/nill/None/whatever.
